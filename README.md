###  <div align= "center"> **The main idea**,
 
To learn React Native and deepen my understanding of application development, I started building this app to help me track my expenses and manage my monthly costs on a daily basis. The code is still under development, but the frontend is almost complete.
  
❖ The application will be connected to my Google Sheets as a database.

❖ I will be able to navigate through the months.

❖ Users can make entries and write to Google Sheets via the app.
